# WiscoAuton

Methodology: 
- I read the image using OpenCV
- I then create lower and upper bounds for the color orange. 
    - I had to constantly change the HSV values to detect the color orange. 
- 


I used the numpy- for matrix operations, CV2 library- for image processing, and the matplotlib- to see the image immediately after running the program.
